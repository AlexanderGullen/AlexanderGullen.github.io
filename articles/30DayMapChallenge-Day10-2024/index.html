		<h2>November 10th 2024</h2>
		<h2 id="subtitle" hidden="true">[Development In Progress]</h2>
		<p>Today is day 9 of the 30DayMapChallenge, and today's theme is "Pen & Paper"</p>

		<p>Fortunately I come from a very artistically talented family</p>
		<img alt="a very well drawn image of a ninja turtle" src="./img4.jpg"/>
		<p>Unfortuately while my sister and my father(the illustrator of the above image) are both highly skilled with a pen and paper, my artistic skills lag far behind, so expect this to be the last well drawn image in this article, sorry ðŸ¤ª.</p>

		<p>I actually ended up drawing three different maps, the first one was in pencil to get a general feeling for drawing the shape of the province, I then used the first map as a template for the second map where I was trying to map out all the highway numbers, but I quickly realized while this might work for northern ontario, southern ontario would be nearly impossible, and completely illegible, especially with my handwriting</p>

		<img alt="three hand drawn maps of ontario with a tablet showing an accurate map of ontario" src="./img1.jpg"/>
		
		<p>After toying around with a few ideas, including trying to physically map the bathymetry of lake superior in rememberance of the <a href="https://youtu.be/PH0K6ojmGZA?si=qU7JyW7cd-cU7Ahu">Edmund Fitzgerald which sunk 49 years ago today</a>, however this idea was quickly scrapped. In the end I decided on something a little more functonal, since joining the MTO I have learned so much about the canadian province of ontario, specifically how much of it I have not had the oppertunity to explore, to rememdy this I mapped out all places I have spent a considerable amount of time in. My hope is that this as I can explore more of this beautiful provice/country I can keep adding places to this map. A man can dream can't he?</p>

		<p>Anyway hope you enjoyed this short artistic excursion, please tune in tomorrow when I will be back to my regular content.</p>
